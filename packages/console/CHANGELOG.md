# @rudderjs/console

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b461123: Declare `engines.node: "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"` on every published package and on the scaffolder-generated `package.json` template.

  Matches the actual runtime floor enforced transitively by `vite@7` (`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`) and `vike` (`>=20.19.0`). Previously the requirement was only mentioned in the install guide — adding it to `engines.node` surfaces the floor at `pnpm install` / `npm install` time via the package manager's engines warning, rather than waiting for runtime / transitive errors.

  Not a breaking API change — `engines` is advisory by default (package managers warn but don't refuse without `engineStrict=true`).

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 95e9f4a: Include `boost/` directory in npm tarball so `guidelines://<pkg>` MCP resources are available in installed apps.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1d81533: Graduate `@rudderjs/console` to 1.0.0.

  The command registry (`Rudder` / `rudder`), `CommandBuilder` chain, `Command` abstract class (with argument/option accessors, output helpers `info`/`error`/`warn`/`line`/`comment`/`newLine`/`table`, and prompt helpers `ask`/`confirm`/`choice`/`secret`), `parseSignature()`, the `MakeSpec` scaffolder pipeline (`registerMakeSpecs`/`getMakeSpecs`/`executeMakeSpec`), and the `CommandObserverRegistry` are now stable.

  `CliError` moves from `@rudderjs/cli` to `@rudderjs/console`. `@rudderjs/cli` keeps re-exporting it for backwards compatibility, so `import { CliError } from '@rudderjs/cli'` continues to work — but new code should import from `@rudderjs/console` (where the rest of the command primitives live).

  Boost guidelines were corrected — prior versions documented prompt methods (`prompt`, `select`, `multiselect`, `success`) that don't exist on the `Command` class. The real names are `ask`, `choice`, `info`.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 8411cd5: **Renamed `@rudderjs/rudder` → `@rudderjs/console`** to match Laravel's `Illuminate\Console` namespace and remove the "rudder rudder" stutter (the binary is `rudder`, the framework is RudderJS, and the authoring package is now `console` — no more triple-naming collision).

  **Migration for consumers:**

  ```ts
  // before
  import { Rudder, Command } from "@rudderjs/rudder";

  // after
  import { Rudder, Command } from "@rudderjs/console";
  ```

  **No symbol changes** — `Rudder`, `Command`, `CommandRegistry`, `CommandBuilder`, `MakeSpec`, `CancelledError`, `parseSignature`, `commandObservers` all keep their names. Only the import path changes.

  **No CLI changes** — the binary is still `rudder` (`pnpm rudder ...`), and the runner package is still `@rudderjs/cli`. Internal dependency updates only.

  **Naming model after this rename:**

  | Concept                 | Package                 | Surface               |
  | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
  | Author HTTP routes      | `@rudderjs/router`      | `Route.get(...)`      |
  | Run HTTP routes         | `@rudderjs/server-hono` | (boots HTTP server)   |
  | Author console commands | `@rudderjs/console`     | `Rudder.command(...)` |
  | Run console commands    | `@rudderjs/cli`         | `rudder` binary       |

  The old `@rudderjs/rudder` will be deprecated on npm with a pointer to `@rudderjs/console` after publish.

> Renamed from `@rudderjs/rudder` on 2026-04-28. Version history continues from the `@rudderjs/rudder` line. The `@rudderjs/rudder` package on npm has been deprecated with a pointer here.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- e1189e9: Rolling patch release covering recent work across the monorepo:

  - **@rudderjs/mcp** — HTTP transport with SSE, OAuth 2.1 resource server (delegated to `@rudderjs/passport`), DI in `handle()`, `mcp:inspector` CLI, output schemas, URI templates, standalone client tools
  - **@rudderjs/passport** — OAuth 2 server with authorization code + PKCE, client credentials, refresh token, and device code grants; `registerPassportRoutes()`; JWT tokens; `HasApiTokens` mixin; smoke test suite
  - **@rudderjs/telescope** — MCP observer entries; Laravel request-detail parity (auth user, headers, session, controller, middleware, view)
  - **@rudderjs/boost** — Replaced ESM-incompatible `require('node:*')` calls in `server.ts`, `docs-index.ts`, `tools/route-list.ts` with top-level imports
  - **create-rudder-app** — MCP and passport options; live config wiring; scaffolder template fixes
  - **All packages** — Drift fixes in typechecks and tests after auth/migrate/view refactors; lint fixes (`oauth2.ts`, `telescope/routes.ts`); removed stale shared `tsBuildInfoFile` from `tsconfig.base.json` so per-package buildinfo no longer clobbers across packages

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Export `Rudder` alias and `CancelledError` class — required by `@rudderjs/core` re-exports.
