# @rudderjs/concurrency

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 95e9f4a: Include `boost/` directory in npm tarball so `guidelines://<pkg>` MCP resources are available in installed apps.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1d4f50b: test: fill coverage gaps

  - `@rudderjs/view`: `view()` with no props defaults to `{}`, `isViewResponse(undefined)` returns `false`, `SafeString.toString()` returns the raw value.
  - `@rudderjs/localization`: `trans()` caching round-trip, `{0}` plural-branch resolution for `count = 0`, simple two-part pluralize fallback.
  - `@rudderjs/concurrency`: `defer()` swallows AND logs errors, `restore()` after `fake()` recreates the worker driver.

  No behavior changes — coverage only.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- eda23b0: Graduate to 1.0.0. The `Concurrency` static facade — `Concurrency.run()` (parallel worker-pool dispatch), `Concurrency.defer()` (fire-and-forget), `Concurrency.fake()` / `Concurrency.restore()` (sync driver for testing) — is now part of the stable public API.

  Dogfooded in the playground via the Fibonacci demo (`/demos/fibonacci` → compute `fib(n)` N times sequentially vs in parallel via worker pool). Verified 5.7× speedup on `fib(38) × 8` (5293ms → 923ms) and 2.9× on `fib(36) × 4` (882ms → 307ms).

  **Breaking changes:**

  - Removed unused `ConcurrencyConfig` interface export. The interface was exported but never wired into any constructor or method — it had no functional effect. Pool size remains fixed at `os.cpus().length`. Runtime configuration can be added in 1.x if real users need it.

  **Docs refresh:**

  - README: added Common Pitfalls section (closure scope, structured-cloneable returns, defer error swallowing, Vite SSR + dist requirement, I/O-bound antipattern, fake state global) and Key Imports.
  - `boost/guidelines.md`: removed the dead `ConcurrencyConfig` import line — it didn't compile against an unconfigurable API.
  - Pool-size default + 1.0 config-API rationale documented in README.
