# @rudderjs/queue-bullmq

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 7eab2d2: Author `boost/guidelines.md` for the 6 packages that previously had no boost content. Adopting apps now get per-package guidelines for these packages too — `@rudderjs/boost` was already capable of consuming them, only the source content was missing.

  Also adds `"boost"` to the `files` array in `package.json` for the 5 packages that didn't include it (`@rudderjs/terminal` already did), so the guidelines actually ship via npm.

  No code changes.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 4d4991c: fix(orm,queue-bullmq,queue-inngest): Tier 3 quality sweep — JSON parse guards, BullMQ double-execution fix, dispatch serialization errors

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8689218: **`@rudderjs/horizon`** — Fix the BullMQ correctness bug where every job appeared stuck at `pending` forever on the dashboard, even after the worker terminal logged `✓ completed` / `✗ failed`.

  Two stacked architectural bugs are fixed in one change:

  1. `JobCollector` was monkey-patching `dispatch()` and mutating `job.handle` on the in-memory `Job` instance. BullMQ serializes the job via `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(job))` and reconstructs a fresh instance in the worker process — so the wrapped handler that was supposed to flip status to `processing` / `completed` / `failed` lived only in the dispatcher's heap and was never reached.
  2. `MemoryStorage` is per-process. The dev/web process and the worker process held separate in-memory arrays with no path to share state; even if the wrap had survived, the dashboard process couldn't see what the worker recorded.

  **Fix shape:**

  - `@rudderjs/queue` now exposes a `@rudderjs/queue/observers` subpath — a `QueueObserverRegistry` singleton on `globalThis` that adapters emit lifecycle events to. Same pattern as `@rudderjs/mcp/observers`, `@rudderjs/http/observers`, etc.
  - The built-in `SyncAdapter` and `@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`'s `BullMQAdapter` emit `job.dispatched` / `job.active` / `job.completed` / `job.failed` events at the right lifecycle points. BullMQ emits `active` from the worker process via `processor()`, and `completed` / `failed` via `worker.on(...)` — the exact transitions that previously didn't reach the dashboard.
  - `@rudderjs/horizon` adds a third storage driver, `RedisStorage`, alongside `MemoryStorage` and `SqliteStorage`. The `JobCollector` is rewritten to subscribe to `queueObservers` instead of monkey-patching the adapter — observer events emitted in the worker process flow through Redis to the dashboard process.
  - `WorkerCollector` only self-registers when `RUDDERJS_QUEUE_WORKER=1` is set. The CLI sets it before booting providers when running `queue:work`, and the BullMQ adapter sets it again defensively before instantiating `Worker`s — so the dev/web process no longer lists itself as a worker.
  - `HorizonProvider.boot()` warns when `queue: bullmq` + `horizon.storage: memory` is detected, surfacing the misconfig before it manifests as a dead dashboard.

  **Migration:**

  If you're using `@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`, switch `config/horizon.ts` to:

  ```ts
  import { Env } from "@rudderjs/core";
  import type { HorizonConfig } from "@rudderjs/horizon";

  export default {
    storage: "redis",
    redis: {
      url: Env.get("REDIS_URL", ""),
      host: Env.get("REDIS_HOST", "127.0.0.1"),
      port: Env.getNumber("REDIS_PORT", 6379),
      password: Env.get("REDIS_PASSWORD", ""),
      prefix: "rudderjs",
    },
    // … rest of config unchanged
  } satisfies HorizonConfig;
  ```

  `ioredis` is now an optional dep — if you have `@rudderjs/queue-bullmq` installed, you already have it.

  If you're on the `sync` driver, no migration needed — `MemoryStorage` continues to work and `'memory'` stays the default.

  **Why a major bump:** the storage interface adds a third driver, the config interface adds `redis`, and the runtime path for BullMQ users changes meaningfully. The public `Horizon` facade (`recentJobs()` / `failedJobs()` / etc.) is unchanged.

  **`@rudderjs/queue`** — additive: new `@rudderjs/queue/observers` subpath. `SyncAdapter.dispatch()` now emits four lifecycle events. Existing consumers that don't subscribe see no behavior change.

  **`@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`** — emits the same lifecycle events from the dispatcher and worker processes. Sets `RUDDERJS_QUEUE_WORKER=1` before instantiating BullMQ `Worker`s.

  **`@rudderjs/cli`** — sets `RUDDERJS_QUEUE_WORKER=1` when argv includes `queue:work`, before booting providers, so cross-cutting collectors can self-register at the right time.

  Pulse's queue recorder has the same architecture as the old horizon JobCollector and currently misses BullMQ worker-side events too. Documented as a known limitation in pulse's README; fix deferred to a follow-up that subscribes the recorder to `queueObservers`.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- cd38418: ## RudderJS 1.0 — wave 1

  Graduate 29 framework packages from `0.x` to `1.0.0`. The first batch of `@rudderjs/*` packages is now public-API stable — breaking changes will require explicit major bumps and migration notes from here on.

  **No code changes** — this is a version-line reset. Existing `0.x` consumers need to update their `@rudderjs/*` ranges from `^0.x.y` to `^1.0.0`. The scaffolder (`create-rudder-app`) is updated to emit `1.x` ranges.

  **Why now.** Under semver caret rules, `^0.X.Y` is exact-minor — every minor bump on a `0.x` peer goes out of range and triggers a cascading major bump on every dependent. Even with the `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` flag in place, the `0.x` baseline keeps producing spurious cascades. Telescope's v9 is mostly that. Once at `1.0`, `^1.0.0` absorbs all `1.x` minor/patch updates — cascades only fire for actual breaking changes.

  **Cascade noise will drop significantly:**

  - `^1.0.0` absorbs all 1.x minor/patch updates
  - Cascade now only fires for actual breaking changes (real majors)

  **Packages graduating to 1.0.0 in this wave:**

  `@rudderjs/contracts`, `core`, `support`, `log`, `hash`, `crypt`, `context`, `testing`, `middleware`, `cache`, `session`, `broadcast`, `schedule`, `mail`, `notification`, `storage`, `localization`, `pennant`, `socialite`, `queue-bullmq`, `queue-inngest`, `router`, `server-hono`, `view`, `orm`, `orm-prisma`, `passport`, `boost`, `ai`.

  `@rudderjs/ai` was originally on the defer list (recent runtime-agnostic split), but it peer-depends on `@rudderjs/core` — graduating core forces ai to graduate via cascade regardless. Listing it explicitly so the version line is intentional rather than a side-effect.

  **Packages NOT yet graduated (still 0.x), to graduate individually as they stabilize:**

  - _Too new / not yet exercised in the dogfood loop:_ `@rudderjs/concurrency`, `image`, `process`, `http`, `console`
  - _Recent significant changes:_ `@rudderjs/orm-drizzle`, `sync`, `vite`

  These will only patch-bump in this release (cascade via regular `dependencies`, not `peerDependencies`).

  **Already past 1.0 (untouched by this release):** `@rudderjs/auth`, `cli`, `mcp`, `queue`, `horizon`, `pulse`, `sanctum`, `telescope`, `cashier-paddle`. These keep their existing version lines; no reset.

  **Expected cascade:** dependents like `telescope`, `pulse`, `horizon`, `cli`, `auth`, `mcp`, `queue`, `sanctum` will major-bump in this release because their peer/dep ranges shifted from `^0.x` to `^1.0.0`. This is the _last_ spurious cascade — future releases of those packages will patch-bump on in-range peer updates.
