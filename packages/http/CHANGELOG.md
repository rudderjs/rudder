# @rudderjs/http

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b461123: Declare `engines.node: "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"` on every published package and on the scaffolder-generated `package.json` template.

  Matches the actual runtime floor enforced transitively by `vite@7` (`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`) and `vike` (`>=20.19.0`). Previously the requirement was only mentioned in the install guide — adding it to `engines.node` surfaces the floor at `pnpm install` / `npm install` time via the package manager's engines warning, rather than waiting for runtime / transitive errors.

  Not a breaking API change — `engines` is advisory by default (package managers warn but don't refuse without `engineStrict=true`).

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 95e9f4a: Include `boost/` directory in npm tarball so `guidelines://<pkg>` MCP resources are available in installed apps.
- 704ae11: fix(storage,http,broadcast,log): Tier 4 quality sweep — S3 CopySource encoding, HTTP json() guard, WebSocket send guard, broadcast auth error surface, log cleanup error surface

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8ca33a1: Graduate to 1.0.0. The `Http` facade, fluent `PendingRequest` builder, `Pool` (concurrency-controlled batches), `FakeManager` (testing helpers), `http()` factory, and the `httpObservers` registry exposed at `@rudderjs/http/observers` are now part of the stable public API.

  Already dogfooded in the playground and consumed by `@rudderjs/telescope`'s HTTP collector via the observer contract. Future breaking changes will be flagged with major bumps and migration notes.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- e1189e9: Rolling patch release covering recent work across the monorepo:

  - **@rudderjs/mcp** — HTTP transport with SSE, OAuth 2.1 resource server (delegated to `@rudderjs/passport`), DI in `handle()`, `mcp:inspector` CLI, output schemas, URI templates, standalone client tools
  - **@rudderjs/passport** — OAuth 2 server with authorization code + PKCE, client credentials, refresh token, and device code grants; `registerPassportRoutes()`; JWT tokens; `HasApiTokens` mixin; smoke test suite
  - **@rudderjs/telescope** — MCP observer entries; Laravel request-detail parity (auth user, headers, session, controller, middleware, view)
  - **@rudderjs/boost** — Replaced ESM-incompatible `require('node:*')` calls in `server.ts`, `docs-index.ts`, `tools/route-list.ts` with top-level imports
  - **create-rudder-app** — MCP and passport options; live config wiring; scaffolder template fixes
  - **All packages** — Drift fixes in typechecks and tests after auth/migrate/view refactors; lint fixes (`oauth2.ts`, `telescope/routes.ts`); removed stale shared `tsBuildInfoFile` from `tsconfig.base.json` so per-package buildinfo no longer clobbers across packages
