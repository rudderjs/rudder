# @rudderjs/queue-inngest

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- b461123: Declare `engines.node: "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"` on every published package and on the scaffolder-generated `package.json` template.

  Matches the actual runtime floor enforced transitively by `vite@7` (`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`) and `vike` (`>=20.19.0`). Previously the requirement was only mentioned in the install guide — adding it to `engines.node` surfaces the floor at `pnpm install` / `npm install` time via the package manager's engines warning, rather than waiting for runtime / transitive errors.

  Not a breaking API change — `engines` is advisory by default (package managers warn but don't refuse without `engineStrict=true`).

- Updated dependencies [b461123]
  - @rudderjs/queue@4.1.3

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 7eab2d2: Author `boost/guidelines.md` for the 6 packages that previously had no boost content. Adopting apps now get per-package guidelines for these packages too — `@rudderjs/boost` was already capable of consuming them, only the source content was missing.

  Also adds `"boost"` to the `files` array in `package.json` for the 5 packages that didn't include it (`@rudderjs/terminal` already did), so the guidelines actually ship via npm.

  No code changes.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4d4991c: fix(orm,queue-bullmq,queue-inngest): Tier 3 quality sweep — JSON parse guards, BullMQ double-execution fix, dispatch serialization errors

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- cd38418: ## RudderJS 1.0 — wave 1

  Graduate 29 framework packages from `0.x` to `1.0.0`. The first batch of `@rudderjs/*` packages is now public-API stable — breaking changes will require explicit major bumps and migration notes from here on.

  **No code changes** — this is a version-line reset. Existing `0.x` consumers need to update their `@rudderjs/*` ranges from `^0.x.y` to `^1.0.0`. The scaffolder (`create-rudder-app`) is updated to emit `1.x` ranges.

  **Why now.** Under semver caret rules, `^0.X.Y` is exact-minor — every minor bump on a `0.x` peer goes out of range and triggers a cascading major bump on every dependent. Even with the `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` flag in place, the `0.x` baseline keeps producing spurious cascades. Telescope's v9 is mostly that. Once at `1.0`, `^1.0.0` absorbs all `1.x` minor/patch updates — cascades only fire for actual breaking changes.

  **Cascade noise will drop significantly:**

  - `^1.0.0` absorbs all 1.x minor/patch updates
  - Cascade now only fires for actual breaking changes (real majors)

  **Packages graduating to 1.0.0 in this wave:**

  `@rudderjs/contracts`, `core`, `support`, `log`, `hash`, `crypt`, `context`, `testing`, `middleware`, `cache`, `session`, `broadcast`, `schedule`, `mail`, `notification`, `storage`, `localization`, `pennant`, `socialite`, `queue-bullmq`, `queue-inngest`, `router`, `server-hono`, `view`, `orm`, `orm-prisma`, `passport`, `boost`, `ai`.

  `@rudderjs/ai` was originally on the defer list (recent runtime-agnostic split), but it peer-depends on `@rudderjs/core` — graduating core forces ai to graduate via cascade regardless. Listing it explicitly so the version line is intentional rather than a side-effect.

  **Packages NOT yet graduated (still 0.x), to graduate individually as they stabilize:**

  - _Too new / not yet exercised in the dogfood loop:_ `@rudderjs/concurrency`, `image`, `process`, `http`, `console`
  - _Recent significant changes:_ `@rudderjs/orm-drizzle`, `sync`, `vite`

  These will only patch-bump in this release (cascade via regular `dependencies`, not `peerDependencies`).

  **Already past 1.0 (untouched by this release):** `@rudderjs/auth`, `cli`, `mcp`, `queue`, `horizon`, `pulse`, `sanctum`, `telescope`, `cashier-paddle`. These keep their existing version lines; no reset.

  **Expected cascade:** dependents like `telescope`, `pulse`, `horizon`, `cli`, `auth`, `mcp`, `queue`, `sanctum` will major-bump in this release because their peer/dep ranges shifted from `^0.x` to `^1.0.0`. This is the _last_ spurious cascade — future releases of those packages will patch-bump on in-range peer updates.
