# @rudderjs/terminal

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7eab2d2: Author `boost/guidelines.md` for the 6 packages that previously had no boost content. Adopting apps now get per-package guidelines for these packages too — `@rudderjs/boost` was already capable of consuming them, only the source content was missing.

  Also adds `"boost"` to the `files` array in `package.json` for the 5 packages that didn't include it (`@rudderjs/terminal` already did), so the guidelines actually ship via npm.

  No code changes.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 31d0c31: Add `@rudderjs/terminal` — `terminal('id', props)` renders Ink/React components from `app/Terminal/` in rudder commands, mirroring the `view()` ergonomics for the browser. Also adds `make:terminal` scaffolder to `@rudderjs/cli`.
