## 4.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 69ad453: Route 5 cross-bundle singletons through `globalThis` so duplicate bundles of these packages share state. Defensive sweep of the same "module-scoped state ≠ bundle-split-survival" pattern that produced #498 / #500–#506 (static-state registries) and #507 (router) and #514 (mcp metadata symbols).

  | Singleton       | Package              | Global key                        | Risk if unfixed                                                                                                                             |
  | --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `container`     | `@rudderjs/core`     | `__rudderjs_core_container__`     | Defensive — only `Application` imports today, but a direct cross-bundle import would split                                                  |
  | `dispatcher`    | `@rudderjs/core`     | `__rudderjs_core_dispatcher__`    | Multiple packages re-export `dispatch()` — events fired from one bundle don't reach listeners in another                                    |
  | `schedule`      | `@rudderjs/schedule` | `__rudderjs_schedule_singleton__` | User registers tasks in `routes/console.ts`; cron runner + telescope's ScheduleCollector read from a different bundle's Scheduler → no jobs |
  | `customDrivers` | `@rudderjs/log`      | `__rudderjs_log_custom_drivers__` | Public `extendLog('sentry', ...)` API — write to one bundle's Map, read from another → "Unknown driver" on every channel                    |
  | `_chainStates`  | `@rudderjs/queue`    | `__rudderjs_queue_chain_states__` | Chain.dispatch() stamps state on each job; worker reads via `getChainState(this)` — split = state silently lost                             |

  No public API change. Same shape as `groupMiddlewareStore` (long-standing globalThis precedent in `@rudderjs/core`).

  Out-of-scope: `queue/_locks` (documented process-local fallback — "use cache for production"), `server-hono/perf-boundaries` (single-module scope, no cross-bundle access).

## 4.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 13e5fb6: Route `QueueRegistry`'s adapter state through `globalThis` so the registry survives the case where `@rudderjs/queue` is loaded twice — typical in a Vite-bundled server where the framework bundles `@rudderjs/queue` inline (both `Queue.dispatch` and worker boot read `QueueRegistry`), but driver packages (`@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`) are externalized and resolve their own copy of `@rudderjs/queue` from `node_modules`. Without a shared store, `set()` from the externalized driver would land on a different class than the one `Queue.*` reads from inside the bundle, producing a misleading `No queue adapter registered` error on every `Queue.dispatch` call in prod.

  No public API change — same `set` / `get` / `reset` surface. Same pattern as PR #498 (`@rudderjs/orm` `ModelRegistry`), PR #500 (`@rudderjs/pennant`), and PR #501 (`@rudderjs/cache`).

## 4.1.3

### Patch Changes

- b461123: Declare `engines.node: "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"` on every published package and on the scaffolder-generated `package.json` template.

  Matches the actual runtime floor enforced transitively by `vite@7` (`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`) and `vike` (`>=20.19.0`). Previously the requirement was only mentioned in the install guide — adding it to `engines.node` surfaces the floor at `pnpm install` / `npm install` time via the package manager's engines warning, rather than waiting for runtime / transitive errors.

  Not a breaking API change — `engines` is advisory by default (package managers warn but don't refuse without `engineStrict=true`).

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ab9d0a4: Fix two latent `@rudderjs/cache` integration bugs in the queue middleware and unique-job lock.

  - **`RateLimited` and `ThrottlesExceptions` no longer throw on first use.** Both middlewares were calling `cache.put(...)` even though `CacheAdapter` only exposes `set`. The bug was masked before #212 because `_getCache()` used CommonJS `require('@rudderjs/cache')` from inside an ESM module, threw, was swallowed by the `try/catch`, and the middlewares fell through to the "no cache — fail open" path. #212 converted `_getCache()` to `await import(...)`, so a real adapter is now returned and the missing-method `TypeError` surfaces on the first job that hits either middleware. Switched both calls to `cache.set(...)` and tightened the local `CacheLike` interface to match.

  - **`acquireUniqueLock` / `releaseUniqueLock` now talk to `@rudderjs/cache`.** Same root cause: `unique.ts` still used CJS `require('@rudderjs/cache')` from ESM, so the cache branch in both helpers was permanently unreachable and `ShouldBeUnique` jobs silently fell through to the in-process `_locks` Map (no cross-process uniqueness). Switched to `await import(...)`, made `_getCache()` async, and updated the two awaited call sites. Also fixed the same `cache.put` → `cache.set` mistake on the unique-key write.

  Adds `RateLimited`, `ThrottlesExceptions`, and `acquireUniqueLock`/`releaseUniqueLock` test coverage backed by `FakeCacheAdapter` so any regression on either path now fails CI.

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0420c1e: Add atomic `Cache.lock()` API + refactor `WithoutOverlapping` and `schedule.withoutOverlapping()`/`onOneServer()` to use it (Laravel parity #1).

  **`@rudderjs/cache` (minor — additive):**

  - `Cache.lock(name, seconds)` — non-blocking try-acquire returning a `Lock` with `get()` / `get(callback)` / `block(seconds, callback?)` / `release()` / `forceRelease()` / `owner()`.
  - `Cache.restoreLock(name, owner)` — rebuild a lock handle by owner token for cross-process release (capture `lock.owner()` on the dispatcher, release on the worker).
  - Driver implementations: in-process `MemoryLock` (single-process only — documented caveat) and `RedisLock` (atomic `SET NX EX` acquire + Lua compare-and-delete release).
  - Owner-checked release: `lock.release()` returns `false` if the holder doesn't match (no more "release-someone-else's-lock" race when TTLs collide); `forceRelease()` bypasses the check for orphan recovery.
  - `block(seconds)` waits with ~250ms polling and throws `LockTimeoutError` on timeout.
  - `FakeCacheAdapter` records `lock-acquire` / `lock-release` / `lock-force-release` ops with `assertLockAcquired(name)` / `assertLockReleased(name)`.

  **`@rudderjs/queue` (patch — internal refactor):**

  - `WithoutOverlapping` now uses `Cache.lock()` instead of a check-then-set against the regular cache. Closes a race where two workers could both observe `null`, both write the lock, and both proceed; closes a "release-someone-else's-lock" bug when the holder's TTL elapsed mid-execution.
  - `WithoutOverlapping` now requires `@rudderjs/cache` to be installed and registered — overlap protection without a cache adapter is silently broken under contention, so it fails fast with a clear error rather than running unprotected.
  - Adds `@rudderjs/cache` as an optional peer dependency.

  **`@rudderjs/schedule` (patch — internal refactor):**

  - `schedule.withoutOverlapping()` and `schedule.onOneServer()` now use `Cache.lock()`. Closes the same race for cross-server coordination — across N app boxes ticking the same minute, exactly one will acquire the `onOneServer` lock.
  - Adds `@rudderjs/cache` as an optional peer dependency.

  No public API changes for queue/schedule consumers.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8689218: **`@rudderjs/horizon`** — Fix the BullMQ correctness bug where every job appeared stuck at `pending` forever on the dashboard, even after the worker terminal logged `✓ completed` / `✗ failed`.

  Two stacked architectural bugs are fixed in one change:

  1. `JobCollector` was monkey-patching `dispatch()` and mutating `job.handle` on the in-memory `Job` instance. BullMQ serializes the job via `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(job))` and reconstructs a fresh instance in the worker process — so the wrapped handler that was supposed to flip status to `processing` / `completed` / `failed` lived only in the dispatcher's heap and was never reached.
  2. `MemoryStorage` is per-process. The dev/web process and the worker process held separate in-memory arrays with no path to share state; even if the wrap had survived, the dashboard process couldn't see what the worker recorded.

  **Fix shape:**

  - `@rudderjs/queue` now exposes a `@rudderjs/queue/observers` subpath — a `QueueObserverRegistry` singleton on `globalThis` that adapters emit lifecycle events to. Same pattern as `@rudderjs/mcp/observers`, `@rudderjs/http/observers`, etc.
  - The built-in `SyncAdapter` and `@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`'s `BullMQAdapter` emit `job.dispatched` / `job.active` / `job.completed` / `job.failed` events at the right lifecycle points. BullMQ emits `active` from the worker process via `processor()`, and `completed` / `failed` via `worker.on(...)` — the exact transitions that previously didn't reach the dashboard.
  - `@rudderjs/horizon` adds a third storage driver, `RedisStorage`, alongside `MemoryStorage` and `SqliteStorage`. The `JobCollector` is rewritten to subscribe to `queueObservers` instead of monkey-patching the adapter — observer events emitted in the worker process flow through Redis to the dashboard process.
  - `WorkerCollector` only self-registers when `RUDDERJS_QUEUE_WORKER=1` is set. The CLI sets it before booting providers when running `queue:work`, and the BullMQ adapter sets it again defensively before instantiating `Worker`s — so the dev/web process no longer lists itself as a worker.
  - `HorizonProvider.boot()` warns when `queue: bullmq` + `horizon.storage: memory` is detected, surfacing the misconfig before it manifests as a dead dashboard.

  **Migration:**

  If you're using `@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`, switch `config/horizon.ts` to:

  ```ts
  import { Env } from "@rudderjs/core";
  import type { HorizonConfig } from "@rudderjs/horizon";

  export default {
    storage: "redis",
    redis: {
      url: Env.get("REDIS_URL", ""),
      host: Env.get("REDIS_HOST", "127.0.0.1"),
      port: Env.getNumber("REDIS_PORT", 6379),
      password: Env.get("REDIS_PASSWORD", ""),
      prefix: "rudderjs",
    },
    // … rest of config unchanged
  } satisfies HorizonConfig;
  ```

  `ioredis` is now an optional dep — if you have `@rudderjs/queue-bullmq` installed, you already have it.

  If you're on the `sync` driver, no migration needed — `MemoryStorage` continues to work and `'memory'` stays the default.

  **Why a major bump:** the storage interface adds a third driver, the config interface adds `redis`, and the runtime path for BullMQ users changes meaningfully. The public `Horizon` facade (`recentJobs()` / `failedJobs()` / etc.) is unchanged.

  **`@rudderjs/queue`** — additive: new `@rudderjs/queue/observers` subpath. `SyncAdapter.dispatch()` now emits four lifecycle events. Existing consumers that don't subscribe see no behavior change.

  **`@rudderjs/queue-bullmq`** — emits the same lifecycle events from the dispatcher and worker processes. Sets `RUDDERJS_QUEUE_WORKER=1` before instantiating BullMQ `Worker`s.

  **`@rudderjs/cli`** — sets `RUDDERJS_QUEUE_WORKER=1` when argv includes `queue:work`, before booting providers, so cross-cutting collectors can self-register at the right time.

  Pulse's queue recorder has the same architecture as the old horizon JobCollector and currently misses BullMQ worker-side events too. Documented as a known limitation in pulse's README; fix deferred to a follow-up that subscribes the recorder to `queueObservers`.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 5ca3e29: Fix type-system contravariance errors that rejected common subclass patterns.

  **`@rudderjs/queue`** — `Job.dispatch`'s `this: new (...args: unknown[]) => T` constraint rejected every subclass with a typed constructor (`constructor(public name: string, public email: string)`). Parameter types are contravariant, so a narrower signature can't satisfy `unknown[]`. Relaxed to `new (...args: any[]) => T`; `ConstructorParameters<typeof this>` still enforces arg-level type safety at the call site.

  **`@rudderjs/auth`** — `Gate.define(ability, callback)` accepted only `(user, ...args: unknown[])` callbacks. A typed callback like `(user, post: Post) => …` failed the same contravariance check. Made `Gate.define` generic on the args tuple so callers can narrow without casting:

  ```ts
  Gate.define<[Post]>("edit-post", (user, post) => user.id === post.authorId);
  ```

  The stored callback is widened to the internal `AbilityCallback` type; narrowing only matters at the call site.

  Both fixes add regression tests covering the subclass-constructor / typed-arg patterns. No runtime behavior change — pure typing fix.
