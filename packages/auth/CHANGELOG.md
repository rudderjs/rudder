# @rudderjs/auth

## 6.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 91927ed: Add `verifyEmailFromRequest(req, findUser)` - a safe-by-default email-verification helper that validates the signed-URL signature itself before matching the email hash and marking the user verified.

  The email hash in a verification link is an unkeyed `sha256(email)`, which anyone who knows a target's email can compute, so the only thing that makes a verification link unforgeable is the URL signature (the `APP_KEY` HMAC). The existing `handleEmailVerification(id, hash, ...)` trusts the route to have validated that signature via `ValidateSignature()` middleware; a route that forgets the middleware makes verification forgeable for any known email. `verifyEmailFromRequest` validates the signature itself and fails closed regardless of middleware wiring (Laravel `EmailVerificationRequest` parity). `handleEmailVerification` is unchanged and still available, with a doc note pointing to the safer helper.

## 6.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 3397d3f: Security hardening of the authentication and authorization surface (deep audit follow-up).

  - **`Gate` policy methods can no longer resolve to an inherited `Object.prototype` member.** The gate looked up a policy ability with a bare `policy[ability]`, so when the ability name collided with an inherited member (`toString`, `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty`, `isPrototypeOf`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, `toLocaleString`), it called that function and treated its truthy result as "allowed" - granting access for any authenticated user against any model with a registered policy. Both gate paths (`Gate.allows` and `Gate.forUser(...).allows`) now resolve the method only from the policy instance's own properties and its prototype chain up to (but excluding) `Object.prototype`; anything inherited from `Object.prototype`, plus the reserved `constructor`/`__proto__`, resolves to a deny. `GateForUser` also now denies a null principal up front, matching `Gate.allows`.

  - **A password reset now cycles the user's "remember me" token (Laravel parity).** A reset is a security event - typically because the account is suspected compromised - but the broker previously only updated the password, leaving any persistent-login cookie captured before the reset valid for its full lifetime. `PasswordBroker.reset` now rotates the stored remember token after a successful reset, invalidating every outstanding remember cookie. Best effort: it is a no-op when the user model has no remember-token column and never fails an otherwise-successful reset.

  - **A row with an empty/missing password hash can no longer authenticate by password.** `EloquentUserProvider.validateCredentials` fed the stored hash straight to the verifier, so an OAuth-only / SSO / not-yet-set account (empty `password` column) depended entirely on the hasher's behavior for an empty digest - a no-op on bcrypt, a throw on argon2, and a potential bypass on a lax custom hasher. It now rejects an empty stored hash explicitly, while still running a dummy verify so the "account has no password" case cannot be told apart from "wrong password" by response latency.

  - **The password-reset rate-limit key is normalized.** The default limiter keyed on the raw submitted email, so `Victim@x.com`, `victim@x.com`, and `victim@x.com` were three separate buckets - letting an attacker multiply the per-account budget against one inbox by varying case/whitespace. The key is now trimmed and lowercased.

## 6.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 866a5dc: Implement "remember me" persistent login. The `remember` flag on `Auth.attempt(creds, true)` / `Auth.login(user, true)` was previously accepted but ignored — login never outlived the session cookie. It now works end to end:

  - On `login(user, true)` the guard mints a 256-bit token, persists it on the user's `rememberToken` column, and (inside an HTTP request) queues a long-lived, HMAC-signed `rudderjs_remember` cookie that `AuthMiddleware` writes to the response.
  - On a later request with no active session but a valid remember cookie, `AuthMiddleware` resolves the user by id, constant-time-compares the cookie token against the stored one, and re-establishes the session before the handler runs. The token is not rotated per request (it changes only on a fresh remember-login or logout), so multiple devices share it.
  - `Auth.logout()` cycles the stored token — invalidating every outstanding remember cookie for that user — and deletes the cookie.
  - `BaseAuthController.signIn` now reads a truthy `remember` field from the request body and threads it through.

  The cookie is signed with `AUTH_SECRET` (required in production; a dev fallback with a one-time notice otherwise, matching `PasswordBroker`). The user model must expose a `rememberToken` column for persistence; apps without one keep working (remember-me is simply a no-op when the provider can't persist the token). New exports: `newRememberToken`, `encodeRememberCookie`, `decodeRememberCookie`, `rememberCookieAttrs`, and the `UserProvider.retrieveByToken` / `updateRememberToken` optional methods.

### Patch Changes

- ad9721d: Close login/password-reset user-enumeration timing oracles.

  `SessionGuard.attempt()` returned immediately when no user matched the credentials, while a wrong password ran the deliberately-expensive bcrypt/argon verify — so an attacker could distinguish registered from unregistered identifiers by response latency. The no-user branch now runs a constant-cost dummy verify (`EloquentUserProvider.fakeValidateCredentials`) against a throwaway hash computed with the app's own hasher, equalizing the timing. `PasswordBroker.sendResetLink()` similarly performs the same early token-store round-trip and token-hash work on the unknown-email branch before returning, flattening the obvious early-return gap behind the already-constant `{ status: 'sent' }` response. (Queue the reset mail so the response doesn't block on delivery to fully close the remaining mail-send gap.)

## 6.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 26e134b: feat(core): WebSocket-upgrade context runner so `Auth.user()` / `Session.*` resolve inside out-of-band callbacks

  A WebSocket upgrade never flows through the HTTP request pipeline, so the session and auth `AsyncLocalStorage` scopes an HTTP handler relies on were never established. `@rudderjs/sync`'s `onAuth(req, docName)` (added in #1011) therefore ran with no ALS — `Auth.user()` returned `null` and apps had to hand-roll cookie → session → user parsing to authorize a collab room by identity.

  `@rudderjs/core` now registers a context runner on `globalThis['__rudderjs_ws_context_runner__']` at `.create()` (dev and prod). Given a raw Node `IncomingMessage` it synthesizes a minimal `AppRequest`, builds a throwaway `AppResponse` (its `Set-Cookie` sink is discarded — there is no HTTP response on an upgrade), and runs **only** the request-scoped-context middleware from the `web` group — session + auth today — onion-style with the caller's callback as the terminal `next`. CSRF, rate-limit, and arbitrary app middleware are deliberately skipped (they assume a full HTTP request and would, e.g., consume a rate-limit token per upgrade).

  Selection is by a new marker: `REQUEST_CONTEXT` (`Symbol.for('rudderjs.requestContext')`, exported from `@rudderjs/contracts` and re-exported from `@rudderjs/core`). `@rudderjs/session`'s `sessionMiddleware` and `@rudderjs/auth`'s `AuthMiddleware` tag the function they return; apps that write their own ALS-establishing middleware can opt in the same way.

  No behavior change on the HTTP path. The runner is consumed by `@rudderjs/sync` in a follow-up; standalone sync (no server adapter, no runner registered) is unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- aaad9ad: `vendor:publish` assets now resolve on Windows. Every provider registered its publish sources via `new URL(...).pathname`, which yields `/D:/...` on Windows (leading slash + percent-encoding) — so `vendor:publish --tag=auth-views` / `notification-schema` / `broadcast-client` / `cashier-*` / the boost guidelines all failed there with missing-source errors. Paths now convert via `fileURLToPath`. Surfaced by the new asset-on-disk test added with the sync-schema tag (#952), which went red on Windows CI.

- 7e6dc85: Require Node ≥ 22.12 (drop Node 20)

  Node 20 ("Iron") reached end-of-life in April 2026, so `engines.node` is now `>=22.12.0` (was `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`). CI tests against the current Active LTS lines, Node 22 and 24. Consumers still on Node 20 will see an `engines` warning at install time — upgrade to Node 22 or 24. The scaffolder-generated app template now declares the same floor.

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c9fe2b: Wire `actingAs(user)` from `@rudderjs/testing` through `AuthMiddleware` so authenticated integration tests actually authenticate.

  In test mode (`APP_ENV=testing`), `AuthMiddleware` now reads the `x-testing-user` header that `@rudderjs/testing` writes via `TestCase.actingAs(user)` and installs the user into a request-scoped ALS via `runWithTestUser(user, ...)`. `SessionGuard.user()` checks this override BEFORE the session/provider lookup — so `req.user`, `auth().user()`, `Auth.guard().check()`, and `RequireAuth` all resolve to the synthetic user, even one that doesn't exist in the database.

  Production is unaffected: the test-mode branch is gated on `process.env.APP_ENV === 'testing'`. The new `runWithTestUser` / `currentTestUser` helpers are exported for completeness; outside test mode they incur no cost.

  **Before this change**, `TestCase.actingAs(user)` wrote the header but no middleware read it — `req.user` was empty and any route guarded by `RequireAuth` (or that called `auth().user()`) failed in tests.

  Found by the Phase 3 testing-ergonomics audit (cluster 2).

## 6.2.2

### Patch Changes

- ace88f0: Reworded "lost-context" errors so they name the correct alternative instead of recommending middleware that won't run on the surface where the error fired. Since the web/api route-group split (`AuthMiddleware` and `sessionMiddleware` auto-install on the `web` group only), the previous messages told API / queue / CLI callers to "use AuthMiddleware" — which is exactly the wrong fix on those surfaces.

  - **`currentAuth()` (`auth-manager.ts`)** — was: `[RudderJS Auth] No auth context. Use AuthMiddleware.` Now points API callers at `RequireBearer() + req.user` (via `@rudderjs/passport`) and queue/CLI callers at passing the user id explicitly.
  - **`Session.current()` (`session/index.ts`)** — was: `[RudderJS Session] No session in context. Use sessionMiddleware.` Now points at `Session.maybeCurrent()` for a non-throwing read on API routes, and mentions per-route `sessionMiddleware()` for the explicit-opt-in case.
  - **`AuthorizationError` from `Gate.authorize()` / `Policy.authorize()` (`auth/gate.ts`)** — base message unchanged ("This action is unauthorized. [<ability>]"). In dev (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`) we now append a one-line hint at the most common cause of an _unexpected_ 403: typo'd ability or missing `Gate.define()` / `Policy.<ability>()`. Stripped in prod so the client-facing JSON stays terse.

  Tests assertions updated to match the new strings. Found by the Phase 2 error-message audit.

## 6.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6c90ca9: Fix the misleading PasswordBroker secret guidance. The dev boot notice, the production-throw error, and the `secret` JSDoc all told you to "Set `auth.passwords.secret` in your config (derived from APP_KEY)" — but `AuthConfig` has no `passwords` field (no such config path), and the canonical source is `AUTH_SECRET`, not `APP_KEY`. The secret is the `secret` option passed to `new PasswordBroker(repo, users, { secret })`, sourced from `AUTH_SECRET` in `.env` — which is what the scaffolder template uses and what `rudder doctor`'s `auth:secret` check validates. All three messages now point at the real mechanism.
- 649b819: Group non-fatal boot-time warnings into one clean block at the end of dev startup. Previously each provider `console.warn`-ed inline as it booted, scattering messages (AI apiKey-skip, auth dev-secret) between the boot sequence and the provider tree with inconsistent prefixes (`[RudderJS AI]`, `[@rudderjs/auth]`, …). `@rudderjs/core` now exposes `bootNotice(scope, message)` — providers record notices during `boot()` and the framework flushes them as a grouped, scope-aligned `⚠ N notices` block after the provider tree and before `ready`, so the dev boot reads banner → tree → notices → ready. `@rudderjs/ai` (apiKey-empty skips) and `@rudderjs/auth` (dev password secret) now route through it. Notices are still printed in production so warnings aren't lost, and a fully-configured app boots with no notices block.

## 6.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 84e5c13: **@rudderjs/auth** — `BaseAuthController` now ships default rate-limits on
  `signIn` (10/min by IP), `signUp` (5/min by IP), and `requestPasswordReset`
  (3/min by email, IP fallback). Override per-method via `static rateLimits`
  on the subclass, or set to `{}` to disable entirely. `@rudderjs/middleware`
  is now a required peer (it's a core package shipped with every scaffolded
  app, so installations that already use `BaseAuthController` are unaffected).

  **@rudderjs/middleware** — `RateLimit` instances now namespace their cache
  key per-handler so siblings keyed by the same identifier don't share a
  bucket. Before: `m.web(RateLimit.perMinute(60))` and a route-scoped
  `RateLimit.perMinute(5)` keyed by IP both wrote to `rudderjs:rl:<ip>`, so 5
  unrelated web-group GETs would drain the route-scoped limiter's quota. Now
  each handler instance owns its own bucket; a shared handler reference
  (`m.web(myLimiter)` applied to multiple routes) still shares a bucket as
  expected. Load-bearing for the Phase 6 default rate-limits above —
  surfaced by the scaffolder render E2E.

  Plan: `docs/plans/2026-05-21-framework-security-fixes.md` Phase 6.

### Patch Changes

- 739cf40: fix(auth): `AuthMiddleware` try/finally + `EnsureEmailIsVerified` typed checks

  Two fail-closed hardening fixes from the 2026-05-21 code review (`docs/plans/2026-05-21-framework-security-fixes.md`, Phases 4 + 5).

  **Phase 4 — `AuthMiddleware` try/finally**

  The post-`next()` sync block that mirrors session changes back onto `req.user` previously ran only on the happy path. A handler that signed the user in (or out) and then threw would skip the sync, so the downstream error renderer saw stale `req.user` — typically empty even though the session had `auth_user_id` set. Now wrapped in `try/finally`: the original handler error propagates unchanged, but the sync runs first so the error path sees the post-sign-in (or post-sign-out) state. Sync failures during the finally never mask the original throw — they're rethrown only when the handler itself succeeded.

  **Phase 5 — `EnsureEmailIsVerified` hardening**

  Two changes:

  - **Re-resolve via the live guard.** Previously the middleware read `req.user.emailVerifiedAt` from the `userToPlain()` snapshot. The snapshot drops methods (so a `MustVerifyEmail` mixin's `hasVerifiedEmail()` is gone) and serializes whatever the column happened to be at request time. Now we call `Auth.user()` first to get the live Model instance; fall back to the snapshot only when no auth context is set or the guard returns null.
  - **Type-narrow the verified-state check.** The previous `!== null && !== undefined` accepted any truthy value: the string `"false"`, the number `0`, the boolean `false`, etc. — all silently passed the gate. If a future Model lets `emailVerifiedAt` slip into a mass-assignable column (the default `fillable: []` policy enforces nothing unless opted in), attacker-supplied values become a privilege boundary. Now `isVerifiedTimestamp(v)` accepts only a real `Date` or a string `Date.parse` can consume.
  - Preferred path: when the User Model implements `MustVerifyEmail`, the mixin's `hasVerifiedEmail()` is authoritative — it rules out the truthy-anything bug entirely.

  **Tests** — `src/middleware-and-verification-fixes.test.ts`, 14 specs:

  - AuthMiddleware: sign-in-then-throw → `req.user` populated; sign-out-then-throw → `req.user` cleared; sync failure during finally doesn't mask the original handler error.
  - EnsureEmailIsVerified: accepts real `Date` + ISO string; rejects `"false"`, `0`, `false`, `""`, `null`, `"unverified"`; honors `MustVerifyEmail` returning `true`/`false`; 401 when no user resolvable.

  Also: `package.json` `test` script now matches `dist-test/*.test.js` instead of hard-coding `index.test.js`, so future per-feature test files are picked up automatically.

  Verified: 92 auth tests pass (78 prior + 14 new); `passport`, `sanctum`, `telescope`, `cashier-paddle` typecheck clean.

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a3a7368: Phase 3 of `rudder doctor` — first wave of package-contributed checks.

  Thirteen framework packages now ship a `<package>/doctor` subpath whose
  side-effect import registers domain-specific health checks on the shared
  doctor registry. The CLI's lazy loader auto-imports them when
  `rudder doctor` runs.

  New checks (14 total, grouped by category):

  - **auth** — `auth:secret` (AUTH_SECRET set + length sane), `auth:views-vendored`
    (vendored when a frontend renderer is installed).
  - **auth** (cont.) — `session:secret` (SESSION_SECRET length when set), `hash:driver`
    (config string ∈ {bcrypt, argon2}; flags missing `argon2` peer).
  - **orm** — `orm-prisma:schema` (schema files present), `orm-prisma:client-generated`
    (mtime check vs schema), `orm-prisma:database-url`, `orm-drizzle:schema`,
    `orm-drizzle:database-url`.
  - **billing** — `cashier-paddle:api-key`, `cashier-paddle:webhook-secret`
    (both conditional on a cashier route being mounted).
  - **queue** — `queue-bullmq:redis-url`, `queue-inngest:event-key`,
    `queue-inngest:signing-key`.
  - **ai** — `ai:provider-keys` (greps `config/ai.ts` for declared driver
    literals, then checks each cloud provider's API key env var).
  - **mcp** — `mcp:route-mounted` (if `app/Mcp/` has tools, mcp route is
    registered).
  - **monitoring** — `telescope:dashboard`, `pulse:dashboard`,
    `horizon:dashboard` (dashboard route reachable from `routes/web.ts`).

  Adding a new contributing package: ship a `<package>/doctor` subpath with
  side-effect `registerDoctorCheck` calls and append the package name to
  `PACKAGES_WITH_CHECKS` in `@rudderjs/cli/src/doctor/load-package-checks.ts`.

  Implementation notes:

  - The CLI's loader resolves doctor subpaths via direct path
    (`<cwd>/node_modules/<pkg>/dist/doctor.js`), not `createRequire.resolve`,
    because the `./doctor` exports condition is `import`-only (no `require`)
    and the strict-mode pnpm node_modules don't expose user-installed
    packages from the CLI's location. Documented as the ESM-only-peer
    resolution workaround.
  - `deps:auth-views` was removed from the CLI's built-in checks — the
    identical concern now lives at `auth:views-vendored` in
    `@rudderjs/auth/doctor`, where it belongs. Net check count for a user
    with `@rudderjs/auth` installed: same (one each); for a user without
    auth, doctor stays silent on the topic instead of saying "auth not
    installed — skip".

  No tests added in this phase — each check is small enough to be tested
  implicitly via integration smoke (the existing temp-dir test suite in
  `@rudderjs/cli`, plus a manual smoke against `playground/`). Per-package
  test suites for these checks may land in a follow-up.

  Phase 4 (`--deep`) and Phase 5 (`--fix`) follow in subsequent releases.

### Patch Changes

- 108c7a2: doctor: Phase 5 — `--fix` mode

  `pnpm rudder doctor --fix` now auto-applies safe fixes for failing checks that declare a `fixer()`. Add `--yes` to skip prompts. The flow runs the fast-path checks, prompts (or auto-applies under `--yes`) for each fixable failure, then re-runs the same checks to confirm.

  First three fixers ship in this release:

  - `deps:providers-manifest` → regenerates `bootstrap/cache/providers.json` in-process (same logic as `rudder providers:discover`)
  - `orm-prisma:client-generated` → shells out `pnpm exec prisma generate`
  - `auth:views-vendored` → copies `node_modules/@rudderjs/auth/views/<fw>/` to `app/Views/Auth/` (never overwrites existing files)

  Fixers must be idempotent regenerate-style operations. Doctor never modifies `.env`, `package.json`, or DB schema, and a fixer that throws is reported as a red fix outcome — doctor itself never crashes.

### Patch Changes

- 32337eb: Route the request-scoped `AuthManager` `AsyncLocalStorage` through `globalThis`
  so duplicate bundles of `@rudderjs/auth` share one ALS instance. Vite/Rollup
  will sometimes inline `auth-manager.js` into more than one SSR chunk (one
  reached via `AuthMiddleware` from the Provider, one reached via the user's
  `import { auth } from '@rudderjs/auth'`). Without this hoist, AuthMiddleware
  writes the manager into one ALS while `auth().user()` reads from another, and
  the handler sees `[RudderJS Auth] No auth context. Use AuthMiddleware.` even
  on requests that did pass through the middleware. Caught by the new Phase 3
  scaffolder render-check matrix. Same pattern as the static-state singleton
  audit (#498/#500–#507/#516).
- Updated dependencies [026af82]
  - @rudderjs/router@1.3.2

## 6.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 765a19d: Route `Gate`'s abilities/policies/before-callbacks through `globalThis` so the registry survives the case where `@rudderjs/auth` is loaded twice — typical in a Vite-bundled server where the framework bundles `@rudderjs/auth` inline (every `Gate.allows()` call reads the registry) but `AuthProvider.boot()` and `Gate.define()` / `Gate.policy()` calls in `AppServiceProvider.boot()` can run from a `node_modules` copy of `@rudderjs/auth` resolved via the provider auto-discovery manifest. Without a shared store, abilities/policies registered from the externalized copy would never be visible to `Gate.allows()` from inside the bundle and every authorization check would silently deny.

  No public API change — same `define` / `before` / `policy` / `allows` / `denies` / `forUser` / `reset` surface. Defensive migration per the #499 static-state singleton audit (the `@rudderjs/auth` provider currently boots from the bundle in practice, so this isn't broken today — but the layout is identical to packages that were). Same pattern as PR #498 (`@rudderjs/orm` `ModelRegistry`), #500 (pennant), #501 (cache), #502 (queue), #503 (mail), #504 (storage), #505 (hash).

### Patch Changes

- b461123: Declare `engines.node: "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"` on every published package and on the scaffolder-generated `package.json` template.

  Matches the actual runtime floor enforced transitively by `vite@7` (`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`) and `vike` (`>=20.19.0`). Previously the requirement was only mentioned in the install guide — adding it to `engines.node` surfaces the floor at `pnpm install` / `npm install` time via the package manager's engines warning, rather than waiting for runtime / transitive errors.

  Not a breaking API change — `engines` is advisory by default (package managers warn but don't refuse without `engineStrict=true`).

### Patch Changes

- 79eadf7: `PasswordBroker` now throws on construction when `auth.passwords.secret` is unset and `NODE_ENV === 'production'`.

Dev and test still boot — they get a one-time `console.warn` and the hardcoded fallback.

  Apps already setting `auth.passwords.secret` (typically derived from `APP_KEY`) are unaffected. Apps relying on the silent fallback in production must set the secret before upgrading.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 937cdac: Adopt three Vike framework-author hooks landed in 2025 for unified DX:

  - **`+onCreatePageContext`** — `@rudderjs/vite` now ships a process-wide page-context enhancer registry. Framework packages register a function via `registerPageContextEnhancer(fn)` and it runs on every page render. The first user: `@rudderjs/auth` populates `pageContext.user` automatically — views no longer need a `+data.ts` to read the current user. The augmentation is typed via the `Vike.PageContext` global namespace.

  - **`+onError`** — Vike SSR errors are now routed through `@rudderjs/core`'s `report()` so they hit the same reporter/renderer chain as HTTP route errors. `@rudderjs/core` is an optional peer; the hook falls back to `console.error` when it's not installed.

  - **`+headersResponse`** — `view('id', props, { headers })` is the new third arg. Pass per-page response headers (`Cache-Control`, CSP, etc.) directly from the controller. The headers can be a plain object or a function (`() => Record<string, string>`) for per-request values like CSP nonces. Framework-owned headers (`set-cookie`, `vary`, anything starting with `x-rudderjs-`) are silently dropped to prevent collisions with server-hono's response pipeline.

  ### Mechanism

  The Vike hooks are wired by the `@rudderjs/vite` views scanner — it writes three one-line re-export stubs to `pages/+onCreatePageContext.ts`, `pages/+onError.ts`, and `pages/+headersResponse.ts` on first sync. These files are user-overwritable: re-running the scanner won't clobber edits. (Vike's `Config.extends` mechanism doesn't support scoped packages, so the scanner generates files that Vike picks up via its native page discovery instead.)

  ### Migration

  - Existing apps: run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` once. The scanner emits the three hook stubs to `pages/` automatically. Commit them. No code changes required.
  - The `pages/__view/+config.ts` scanner output now also adds `viewHeaders` to `passToClient`, so view components can read response-header context if they need to.
  - `pageContext.user` types automatically when both `@rudderjs/auth` and `@rudderjs/vite` are installed.

  ### Out of scope (deferred follow-ups)

  - `@rudderjs/session` flash enhancer (`pageContext.flash`) — adopt the same `registerPageContextEnhancer` pattern.
  - `@rudderjs/localization` locale enhancer (`pageContext.locale`) — same shape.
  - Typed `+rudderRoute` meta — current `export const route = '/...'` works.
  - `+onHookCall` (beta) telescope integration — wait until telescope's request collector is stable.

  ### No API breaks

  - `view(id, props)` (2-arg) still works; the `options` arg is optional.
  - `req.user` flow on HTTP routes is unchanged.
  - No new required dependencies; `@rudderjs/core` is added as an optional peer of `@rudderjs/vite`, and `@rudderjs/vite` is added as an optional peer of `@rudderjs/auth`.

### Patch Changes

- d0db9f0: **`@rudderjs/boost`** — overhauled the generated agent guidelines output.

  Inspired by Laravel Boost's recent shape. Concrete changes:

  - **`CLAUDE.md` is now ~135 lines, down from ~1,350.** Replaced the inline content dump of every package guideline with structured pointers to `.ai/guidelines/<package>.md`. The full per-package content still lives in `.ai/guidelines/` — agents load it on demand.
  - **New structure** in `CLAUDE.md`: XML wrapper (`<rudderjs-boost-guidelines>`), `=== foundation rules ===` / `=== boost rules ===` / `=== skills activation ===` dividers, a Foundational Context section listing installed `@rudderjs/*` versions, a Boost MCP Tools section listing every exposed tool, and a Skills Activation section with explicit `**ACTIVATE when:** …` / `**SKIP when:** …` heuristics per skill.
  - **Skill frontmatter enriched.** Each `SKILL.md` now declares `license`, `appliesTo`, `metadata.author`, plus the new `trigger` and `skip` fields that drive the CLAUDE.md activation section. `appliesTo` is the new filter — skills install only when at least one of their target packages is present (override with `--include-all-skills`).
  - **Three skills modularized** into `SKILL.md` + `rules/*.md`:
    - `orm-models` (`@rudderjs/orm`) — split into 5 rule files (defining-models, querying, crud-and-observers, factories, resources).
    - `auth-setup` (`@rudderjs/auth`) — split into 5 rule files (provider-setup, guards-and-handlers, auth-views, gates-and-policies, email-and-password-reset).
    - `mcp-servers` (`@rudderjs/mcp`) — split into 5 rule files (tools, resources-and-prompts, server-assembly, transports, testing-and-di).
    - Each `SKILL.md` is now a compact Quick Reference (~40 lines) linking to the matching rule file. Rule files use paired Incorrect/Correct examples consistently.
  - **`boost.json`** now records the active skill list under a `skills` field.

  Migration: run `pnpm rudder boost:update` (or `boost:install`) to regenerate the new CLAUDE.md / boost.json / skill files. The old output is fully replaced — local edits to `CLAUDE.md` will be overwritten, same as before. Per-package guidelines and skills install paths are unchanged.

  No API breaks. The `@rudderjs/*` package bumps are guideline / skill content changes for packages that ship `boost/` directories.

- b74fc57: Add `@rudderjs/middleware/client` subpath export for browser-safe helpers. `getCsrfToken()` now lives at this subpath so it can be imported from view code without dragging `@rudderjs/cache`, `node:crypto`, and the rate-limit machinery into the client bundle.

  The main entry still re-exports `getCsrfToken` for backward compatibility, but browser code should import from `@rudderjs/middleware/client`. The four vendored auth views (`Login`, `Register`, `ForgotPassword`, `ResetPassword` under `packages/auth/views/react/`) are updated to use the new subpath — fresh `create-rudder-app` projects will pick up the fix on next install.

  Also replaces `randomUUID` from `node:crypto` with `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID()` in `@rudderjs/cache`'s lock implementation. Both Node 18+ and modern browsers expose the Web Crypto API, so the module no longer crashes when transitively pulled into a client bundle. Fixes the `Module "node:crypto" has been externalized for browser compatibility` runtime error on `/login` and other CSRF-protected forms.

### Patch Changes

- 9b33c2c: Tier 2 quality sweep — error guards, timing safety, lock parity, CORS fix.

  - **crypt**: `decrypt()` / `decryptString()` now throw descriptive errors on malformed base64 or non-JSON input instead of an opaque `SyntaxError`
  - **auth**: `handleEmailVerification()` uses `timingSafeEqual` for email hash comparison; `PasswordResetConfig` gains an optional `secret` field so stored token hashes can be bound to APP_KEY
  - **cache**: `RedisAdapter.get()` catches corrupt JSON entries, evicts them, and returns `null`; `MemoryLock.acquire()` returns `false` for zero-TTL (matches `RedisLock` behaviour)
  - **session**: `verify()` replaces manual XOR loop with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
  - **middleware**: `CorsMiddleware` reflects the matched request origin from an allowlist instead of joining all origins with `', '` (browsers require a single origin value — the old behaviour was silently broken)

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- e8cee45: `BaseAuthController` is now mounted at `/auth/*` instead of `/api/auth/*` (BREAKING).

  The `/api/*` namespace is reserved for token-based API auth (Sanctum / Passport bearer routes); session-based auth lives on the `web` middleware group, matching Laravel's `/login` convention. The previous `/api/auth/*` prefix was a footgun — the URL implied the controller belonged in `routes/api.ts`, but its handlers depend on session/auth ALS context that's only auto-installed on the `web` group.

  What changed:

  - `@Controller('/api/auth')` → `@Controller('/auth')` on `BaseAuthController`. Subclasses inherit the new prefix.
  - The published auth views (`Login`, `Register`, `ForgotPassword`, `ResetPassword`) now default `submitUrl` to `/auth/sign-in/email` / `/auth/sign-up/email` / `/auth/request-password-reset` / `/auth/reset-password`.

  Upgrading an existing app:

  - If you vendored `@rudderjs/auth/views/react/*` into `app/Views/Auth/`, re-publish them (or do a quick find-and-replace from `/api/auth/` → `/auth/` on those files).
  - If you call `BaseAuthController` directly without any subclass URL override, you don't need to do anything else — the controller now serves `POST /auth/sign-in/email` etc. and the bundled views point at the new paths by default.
  - If you depend on the old `/api/auth/*` paths (e.g. external mobile clients, custom front-ends), pass explicit `submitUrl` props to the auth views, or add backwards-compatible alias routes in your `routes/web.ts`.

  `create-rudder-app`'s Welcome view + scaffolded `pages/index` sign-out fetch are updated to match the new paths.

- 231d7f6: Fix two bugs in email verification (`@rudderjs/auth`):

  - **Schema → interface alignment (BREAKING)**: published schemas (`schema/auth.prisma` + Drizzle PG / MySQL / SQLite) now expose a nullable `emailVerifiedAt` timestamp instead of the `emailVerified: boolean` they previously declared. The `EnsureEmailIsVerified` middleware and `MustVerifyEmail` interface have always documented `emailVerifiedAt`, so verified users would get 403s under the old schemas. Apps upgrading need to migrate the column (e.g. `ALTER TABLE user RENAME COLUMN emailVerified TO emailVerifiedAt; ALTER TABLE user ALTER COLUMN emailVerifiedAt TYPE timestamp USING (CASE WHEN emailVerifiedAt THEN now() ELSE NULL END);`) — adapt to your dialect.
  - **ESM `require()` removed**: `verification.ts` previously called `require('@rudderjs/router')` and `require('node:crypto')`, which throw `ReferenceError: require is not defined` in pure ESM consumers — making `verificationUrl()` and `handleEmailVerification()` non-functional. Both are now static ESM imports. `@rudderjs/router` is already a non-optional peer of `@rudderjs/auth`, so the previous try/catch fallback was unnecessary.

  `create-rudder-app`'s scaffolded Prisma + User-model templates are updated to match the new column.

### Minor Changes

- 015e16e: Stop leaking sensitive user columns into `req.user` (T5).

  - `userToPlain(user)` is now exported from `@rudderjs/auth`. Always strips functions plus `password`, `rememberToken`, and `remember_token` (the last two cover both Prisma camelCase and Drizzle/raw-Laravel snake_case schema choices). The previous filter only removed functions and `password`, so columns like `remember_token`, `two_factor_secret`, and `email_verification_token` could surface in `req.user`.
  - `Authenticatable.getHidden?(): string[]` is a new optional method on the contract — Laravel's `$hidden` array. User models that implement it can name app-specific sensitive columns (`two_factor_secret`, `email_verification_token`, …) and `userToPlain` will strip them on top of the always-hidden defaults.
  - `@rudderjs/sanctum`'s middleware now delegates to the shared `userToPlain` instead of inlining a near-duplicate filter loop, so sanctum-authenticated requests inherit the same protection.
  - Fixed a pre-existing bug in `userToPlain` where the spread of the original record was placed _after_ the explicit `String(...)` conversions for `id` / `name` / `email`, silently overriding them. The conversions now win on collision so `id`, `name`, and `email` are guaranteed strings as the `AuthUser` type promises.

- 015e16e: Fix Sanctum's hardwiring to the session driver (T2/T7).

  - `AuthManager.createProvider(name?)` is now public. With no `name`, it falls back to the default guard's configured provider; with a `name`, it resolves any provider in `auth.providers` independently of any guard. Pure-API apps can now use Sanctum without registering `@rudderjs/session` or a session guard.
  - `SanctumServiceProvider.boot()` resolves the user provider through `manager.createProvider(config.provider)` instead of `manager.guard().provider`. The previous code instantiated a `SessionGuard` just to read its provider, which threw on any non-session default guard. The catch around `app.make('auth.manager')` now narrows to "binding not found" only — provider-resolution errors propagate verbatim instead of being rewritten to "No auth manager found".
  - `SanctumConfig.provider?: string` overrides which entry in `auth.providers` Sanctum uses. Required for pure-API apps; optional in mixed (web + API) setups.

### Patch Changes

- 942bd78: Fix two observability inconsistencies in `Gate`:

  - `_getGateObservers()` no longer caches `null`. The previous lazy accessor cached the global lookup on first call; if `Gate.allows()` ran before `gate-observers.ts` was imported, the cache trapped `null` permanently and downstream subscribers (e.g. Telescope's `GateCollector`) never received events even after they subscribed. The lookup is one property read, so dropping the cache costs nothing measurable.
  - `Gate.forUser(user).allows(ability, model)` now reports `resolvedVia: 'policy'` (with the policy name) when the policy is registered but the ability method is missing — matching the static `Gate.allows()` path. The previous `resolvedVia: 'default'` contradicted the static path and miscategorised the event in Telescope.

Replaces non-existent `pkg(configs.pkg)` factory calls with the actual `*Provider` classes (e.g. `import { CacheProvider } from '@rudderjs/cache'` + `[CacheProvider]`), corrects auth's `authProvider(...)` → `AuthProvider` in setup + prose, fixes core's dynamic-registration example to use the real `CacheProvider` class, and updates ai's setup example to import `AiProvider` from the `/server` subpath.

### Patch Changes

- 550518c: Auth views now send `X-CSRF-Token` on form submission

  The vendored React views (`Login`, `Register`, `ForgotPassword`,
  `ResetPassword`) under `views/react/` previously POST'd credentials
  without a CSRF token. Now that `CsrfMiddleware` runs on the `web` group
  by default (the routes registered by `registerAuthRoutes()` live on the
  web group), every POST needs to send the token.

  The views now import `getCsrfToken` from `@rudderjs/middleware` and
  attach `X-CSRF-Token` to the `fetch()` headers. Existing apps that
  vendored the previous views continue to work — they just need to either
  re-vendor (`cp -R node_modules/@rudderjs/auth/views/react/. app/Views/Auth/`)
  or add the header themselves.

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 5fbd6e5: Fix `appendToGroup` auto-install in WebContainer / restrictive runtimes

  Both `AuthProvider.boot()` and `SessionProvider.boot()` previously used a
  dynamic `await import('@rudderjs/core')` wrapped in a silent `try/catch` to
  grab `appendToGroup`. The dynamic import was unnecessary — both files
  already statically import other symbols from `@rudderjs/core` — and the
  catch swallowed any module-resolution error without logging.

  In WebContainer (StackBlitz) the dynamic import fails for reasons related
  to pnpm symlink resolution under WASI-Node, so the catch silently dropped
  the auto-install. Apps ended up booting without `SessionMiddleware` and
  `AuthMiddleware` on the `web` group, causing `auth().user()` to throw
  "No auth context" on any web route.

  Use the static import. No catch.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5239815: Make Tailwind optional in create-rudder-app and refactor auth views to semantic class names.

  `create-rudder-app` now ships two `app/index.css` variants from a single JSX source: a Tailwind `@apply` version (default) and a hand-authored plain CSS version with CSS variables + `prefers-color-scheme` dark mode. Answer "No" to the `Add Tailwind CSS?` prompt to scaffold a zero-Tailwind project that still looks styled out of the box — landing page, auth forms, and error page all render against the plain variant.

  `@rudderjs/auth` React views (Login / Register / ForgotPassword / ResetPassword) are refactored to use the same semantic vocabulary (`auth-wrap`, `form-card`, `form-input`, `auth-link`, …). The visual output is unchanged for Tailwind apps; apps that vendored the previous React auth views will need to re-vendor (`pnpm rudder vendor:publish --tag=auth-views --force` or copy from `node_modules/@rudderjs/auth/views/react/`) and either keep Tailwind or bring their own CSS for the new selectors.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 5ca3e29: Fix type-system contravariance errors that rejected common subclass patterns.

  **`@rudderjs/queue`** — `Job.dispatch`'s `this: new (...args: unknown[]) => T` constraint rejected every subclass with a typed constructor (`constructor(public name: string, public email: string)`). Parameter types are contravariant, so a narrower signature can't satisfy `unknown[]`. Relaxed to `new (...args: any[]) => T`; `ConstructorParameters<typeof this>` still enforces arg-level type safety at the call site.

  **`@rudderjs/auth`** — `Gate.define(ability, callback)` accepted only `(user, ...args: unknown[])` callbacks. A typed callback like `(user, post: Post) => …` failed the same contravariance check. Made `Gate.define` generic on the args tuple so callers can narrow without casting:

  ```ts
  Gate.define<[Post]>("edit-post", (user, post) => user.id === post.authorId);
  ```

  The stored callback is widened to the internal `AbilityCallback` type; narrowing only matters at the call site.

  Both fixes add regression tests covering the subclass-constructor / typed-arg patterns. No runtime behavior change — pure typing fix.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d3d175c: Add `BaseAuthController` + restructure scaffolded auth routes (Laravel Breeze-style).

  **`@rudderjs/auth`** — new `BaseAuthController` abstract class. Ship the five standard auth POST handlers (`sign-in/email`, `sign-up/email`, `sign-out`, `request-password-reset`, `reset-password`) as decorated methods on a base class. Subclasses set `userModel`, `hash`, and `passwordBroker`; override any method to customize. Decorator metadata is inherited through the prototype chain — `Route.registerController(YourAuthController)` picks up all five routes without re-decorating.

  New exports: `BaseAuthController`, `AuthUserModelLike`, `AuthHashLike`.

  **`create-rudder-app`** — two fixes rolled together:

  1. **Bug fix.** The session-mutating auth handlers were emitted into `routes/api.ts`, but `SessionMiddleware` is only auto-installed on the **web** group. `Auth.attempt/login/logout` calls `session.regenerate()`, which threw `No session in context` on sign-up. Auth submit handlers now live on the web group.

  2. **Shape change.** Scaffolded apps now get a real `app/Controllers/AuthController.ts` (extends `BaseAuthController`) instead of ~60 lines inlined in `routes/web.ts`. `routes/web.ts` shrinks to `registerAuthRoutes(Route, { middleware: webMw })` (GETs) + `Route.registerController(AuthController)` (POSTs). Welcome page uses the cleaner `auth().user()` helper — no manual `runWithAuth` / `app().make<AuthManager>()` wrapping.

  Customization path: edit `app/Controllers/AuthController.ts` — subclass `BaseAuthController` methods you want to change, or add new ones. The class-level `@Middleware([authLimit])` decorator applies rate limiting to every POST.

## 3.0.0

### Minor Changes

- ba543c9: Middleware groups — `web` vs `api`, Laravel-style.

  Routes loaded via `withRouting({ web })` are tagged `'web'`; via `withRouting({ api })` tagged `'api'`. The server adapter composes the matching group's middleware stack before per-route middleware. Framework packages install into a group during `boot()` via the new `appendToGroup('web' | 'api', handler)` export on `@rudderjs/core`, instead of calling `router.use(...)` globally.

  - **`MiddlewareConfigurator`** — adds `.web(...handlers)` and `.api(...handlers)` alongside the existing `.use(...)`. Use `m.use(...)` for truly global middleware (logging, request-id), `m.web(...)` / `m.api(...)` for group-scoped middleware.
  - **`@rudderjs/session`** — `sessionMiddleware` now auto-installs on the `web` group. Apps no longer need `m.use(sessionMiddleware(cfg))` in `bootstrap/app.ts`.
  - **`@rudderjs/auth`** — `AuthMiddleware` now auto-installs on the `web` group (was a global `router.use()`). `req.user` is populated on web routes only; api routes are stateless by default and must opt into bearer auth (e.g. `RequireBearer()` from `@rudderjs/passport`).
  - **`SessionGuard.user()`** — soft-fails when no session ALS is in context (returns `null` instead of throwing). Matches Laravel's `Auth::user()` semantics — removes the trap where api routes would 500 with "No session in context" when auth was installed but session was not.
  - **`RouteDefinition.group?: 'web' | 'api'`** — new optional field exposed via `@rudderjs/contracts`. Server adapters may implement `applyGroupMiddleware(group, handler)` to support the feature; adapters without it ignore group tags and behave as before.

  **Breaking:** `req.user` is now `undefined` on api routes unless a bearer/token guard middleware runs. This is intentional — the previous behavior (AuthMiddleware running globally) forced session to be load-bearing on every request, including stateless APIs.
