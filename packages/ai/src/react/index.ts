/**
 * React client runtime for `@rudderjs/ai`.
 *
 * The agent framework, providers, and the runtime-agnostic agent-SSE protocol
 * (`readAgentStream` + the server framers) live in the main `@rudderjs/ai`
 * entry. This subpath adds the React hook that drives a streamed agent run from
 * a component — same split as `@rudderjs/sync/react` (the main entry stays
 * React-free; React lives behind `/react`).
 *
 * Peer requirement: `react@>=19.2.0`.
