/**
 * `@rudderjs/ai/chat-mentions` - parse `@<slug>` agent mentions out of a chat
 * message and turn them into an orchestrator routing rule.
 *
 * A chat UX where the user types `@<slug>` to explicitly invoke an agent
 * (overriding the orchestrator's own routing judgment) is generic: chat
 * panels, Slack/Discord bots, CLIs. This ships the two reusable pieces every
 * such consumer would otherwise hand-roll:
 *
 * - {@link parseMentions} extracts and validates the tokens, returning the
 *   matched slugs plus the message with the tokens stripped.
 * - {@link buildMentionRoutingRule} renders a system-prompt rule that forces
 *   the orchestrator to dispatch the mentioned agents in order.
 *
 * Token shape: `@<slug>` where `<slug>` matches `[a-z0-9-]+`. A whitespace (or
 * start-of-string) is required before the `@` so `email@host` is not parsed as
 * a mention, and the right side is bounded by a non-word boundary so
 * `@seo-assistant.` does not eat the trailing punctuation.
