Fix `make:terminal` generating a broken component (found by dogfooding).

`pnpm rudder make:terminal <Name>` wrote `app/Terminal/<Name>Terminal.ts` — a `.ts` file containing JSX (Ink), which doesn't compile, with a spurious `Terminal` suffix that the `terminal('id')` resolver (`'dashboard'` → `app/Terminal/Dashboard.tsx`) could never find. So scaffolded terminal components neither compiled nor resolved.

- `@rudderjs/console` — `MakeSpec` gains an optional `extension` field (defaults to `ts`); `executeMakeSpec` honors it. Lets a stub opt into `tsx` (or any extension) instead of the hardcoded `.ts`.
- `@rudderjs/terminal` — `makeTerminalSpec` now sets `extension: 'tsx'` and drops the `Terminal` suffix, so `make:terminal Dashboard` produces `app/Terminal/Dashboard.tsx` — which compiles and is resolvable by `terminal('dashboard')`, matching the documented behavior.
