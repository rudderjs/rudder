# RudderJS Feature Roadmap

> Laravel 13 gap analysis — compiled 2026-04-06, last updated 2026-05-18
>
> Legend: S = Small (1-2 days) | M = Medium (3-5 days) | L = Large (1-2 weeks)

> **1.0 graduation, 2026-05-02** — every `@rudderjs/*` package on npm is now 1.0.0+ with zero packages on 0.x. The framework is past the "still finding shape" phase; future roadmap items are additive features, not foundational rewrites.

## Plan 7: Monitoring & Observability — mostly done

*Production visibility — equivalent to Pulse, Telescope, Horizon, Nightwatch.*

**Status**: Telescope (19 collectors), Pulse, and Horizon all shipped at 1.0+ and browser-verified end-to-end as of 2026-05-02 (Pulse + Horizon went through PRs #144 / #146 / #149 / #151 / #153 / #156 / #158 / #160 — cross-process queue collector saga, SQLite WAL storage fix, docs sweep). Telescope dashboard gained **real-time SSE updates** in #431 (2026-05-13). Nightwatch still ⬜ — open question whether to ship a self-hosted dashboard, a SaaS product, or both.

### 7.1 — `@rudderjs/pulse` ✅

**Laravel equivalent**: [Laravel Pulse](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/pulse) — self-hosted performance monitoring dashboard.

**Effort**: Large

**Built-in Cards (9):**
- **Servers** — CPU, memory, storage usage per server (requires background check daemon)
- **Application Usage** — top 10 users by requests, slow requests, or job dispatching
- **Exceptions** — frequency + recency of exceptions, grouped by class + location
- **Queues** — throughput: queued, processing, processed, released, failed
- **Slow Requests** — HTTP requests exceeding configurable threshold (default 1s)
- **Slow Jobs** — queued jobs exceeding configurable threshold (default 1s)
- **Slow Queries** — database queries exceeding threshold, with SQL highlighting
- **Slow Outgoing Requests** — HTTP client requests exceeding threshold
- **Cache** — hit/miss statistics globally and per-key

**Recorders (10):**
- CacheInteractions, Exceptions, Queues, SlowJobs, SlowOutgoingRequests, SlowQueries, SlowRequests, Servers, UserJobs, UserRequests
- Each recorder has: configurable threshold, sample rate, ignore patterns, regex grouping

**Infrastructure:**
- Separate database support (don't pollute app DB)
- Redis ingest driver for non-blocking writes + batched DB inserts
- Configurable sampling per recorder to reduce volume
- Automatic trimming of old data
- Background daemons: `pulse:check` (server metrics), `pulse:work` (Redis stream processing)

**Dashboard:**
- Composable card grid layout (cols, rows, expand)
- Custom card API (create your own cards)
- Auto user resolution (name, email, avatar)
- Gate-based authorization
- Served at `/pulse` route (mounted by the package itself, no host-panel required)

**Depends on**: log, cache, orm

---

### 7.2 — `@rudderjs/telescope` ✅

**Laravel equivalent**: [Laravel Telescope](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/telescope) — development debug assistant.

**Effort**: Large

**Watchers (18 types in Laravel's spec):**
1. **Request Watcher** — HTTP request/response details, headers, payload, status
2. **Query Watcher** — database queries with execution time, slow query threshold (default 100ms)
3. **Exception Watcher** — reportable exceptions with full stack traces
4. **Job Watcher** — job dispatching, status, queue data
5. **Mail Watcher** — in-browser email preview, download as `.eml`
6. **Notification Watcher** — notification sending, channels, recipients
7. **Cache Watcher** — cache hits, misses, updates, deletions
8. **Log Watcher** — application logs, configurable minimum level
9. **Event Watcher** — event payloads, listeners, broadcast data
10. **Command Watcher** — CLI command execution, arguments, exit code
11. **Schedule Watcher** — scheduled task execution and performance
12. **HTTP Client Watcher** — outgoing HTTP requests to external APIs
13. **Model Watcher** — Eloquent model events (created, updated, deleted)
14. **Gate Watcher** — authorization gate and policy check results
15. **View Watcher** — view/page rendering data
16. **Batch Watcher** — queued batch info
17. **Redis Watcher** — Redis commands and responses
18. **Dump Watcher** — `dump()` output capture (dev only)

**Features:**
- Entry-level and batch-level filtering (include/exclude)
- Auto-tagging entries with model class names + authenticated user IDs
- Custom tagging via closures
- Sensitive data masking (passwords, tokens, credit cards)
- Data pruning (configurable retention, default 24h)
- Per-watcher enable/disable via config or env vars

**Dashboard:**
- Self-mounted at `/telescope` (no host-panel required)
- Real-time updates via SSE (#431, 2026-05-13)

### 7.3 — `@rudderjs/horizon` ✅

**Laravel equivalent**: [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/horizon) — Redis queue monitoring + management.

**Effort**: Medium

**Worker Management:**
- 3 balancing strategies: `auto` (dynamic scaling), `simple` (even distribution), `false` (disabled)
- Auto-balancing: `time`-based (estimated clear time) or `size`-based (job count)
- Configurable: `minProcesses`, `maxProcesses`, `balanceMaxShift`, `balanceCooldown`
- Multiple supervisors per environment with separate configs
- Environment-based configuration (production, staging, local)

**Job Management:**
- Per-job class config overrides (tries, timeout, backoff)
- Job silencing (reduce dashboard noise by class, tag, or interface)
- Job tagging for organization and filtering
- Failed job inspection with stack traces
- Retry/delete failed jobs from dashboard
- Clear queues

**Metrics:**
- Job throughput (jobs per unit time)
- Job runtime (execution duration)
- Job failure rates
- Queue length/depth
- Worker process status
- In-progress / completed / failed job lists

**Notifications:**
- Job failure alerts via notification system
- Customizable channels

**Dashboard:**
- Real-time queue monitoring
- Completed, failed, in-progress job views
- Job history and analytics
- Tag-based filtering
- Metrics visualization (charts)

**Depends on**: queue-bullmq

---

### 7.4 — Nightwatch (External Monitoring)

**Laravel equivalent**: [Laravel Nightwatch](https://nightwatch.laravel.com/) — hosted monitoring SaaS.

**Effort**: Large — this is a standalone product, not just a plugin.

**Two options:**
1. **Self-hosted dashboard** — a separate package (e.g. `@rudderjs/nightwatch`) that surfaces monitoring inside an admin app
2. **Hosted SaaS product** — long-term, run by us

**Monitored Event Types (9):**
- Requests — trace with detailed interaction + performance metrics
- Outgoing Requests — external API call monitoring
- Jobs — queue execution, attempts, duration
- Queries — SQL performance, problematic query detection
- Mail — sending, recipients, rendering performance
- Commands — CLI execution, resource impact
- Cache — hit rates, storage patterns, invalidation
- Scheduled Tasks — execution timing, completion status
- Notifications — delivery across all channels

**Connected Events / Tracing:**
- Microsecond-precision event correlation
- Request waterfall view (REQUEST → QUERY → QUERY → CACHE HIT → QUERY)
- Timeline visualization of event sequences

**Smart Alerts:**
- Intelligent grouping of related exceptions
- Noise-reduced notifications
- Issue assignment to team members

**Uptime Monitoring:**
- HTTP/TCP/DNS endpoint checks
- SSL certificate expiry tracking
- Response time tracking
- Status pages
- Incident management

**Depends on**: http, notification, log

## Post-1.0 Enhancements (2026-05+)

Continuous improvements after 1.0 graduated. Not part of plans 1–9 — these came from real-world use surfacing rough edges (most discovered while deploying `pilotiq-io` to production on Forge + MySQL).

| Area | Change | PR | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@rudderjs/vite` | View HMR — `app/Views/**` edits skip framework re-bootstrap, fall through to Vike's native component HMR (~700 ms cold SSR → ~50 ms in-browser refresh) | rudder #517 | ✅ |
| `create-rudder-app` | Recipe-driven scaffolder (Web app / SaaS / API service / Realtime / Minimal / Custom) replaces the 25-option multiselect; auto-cascade runs `prisma generate` + `migrate deploy` + `vendor:publish` + `passport:keys` + `git init` after install; demos dropped from default scaffold | rudder #519 | ✅ |
| `@rudderjs/cli` | New `rudder add <pkg>` — installs + generates config + wires `config/index.ts` + refreshes provider manifest in one step. 25-package registry mirrors the scaffolder. | rudder #520 | ✅ |
| `@rudderjs/cli` | New `rudder remove <pkg>` — reverses `add` end-to-end; refuses when dependents are still installed (`auth` blocked while `sanctum`/`passport` present); `--keep-config` flag preserves the local config | rudder #521 | ✅ |
| `@rudderjs/orm-prisma` | **MySQL / MariaDB driver** via `@prisma/adapter-mariadb` — Forge (and any host that defaults to MySQL) is now a viable production target without installing Postgres alongside | rudder #523 | ✅ |
